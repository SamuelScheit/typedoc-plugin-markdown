## Sidebar

- A manual sidebar file should be referenced in `sidebars.js` rather than autogenerated configuration as previouslly recommended. See [sidebar guide](/plugins/docusaurus/guide/sidebar).
- With the updated configuration the existing sidebar options `position` and `categoryLabel` are no longer relevant.

## Options

- `includeExtension` has been removed as this behaviour is now the default.
- `frontmatter` option has been removed. Please use `typedoc-plugin-frontmatter`.
