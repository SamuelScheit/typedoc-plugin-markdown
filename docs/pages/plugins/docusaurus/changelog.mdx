#### ðŸ’¥ Breaking Changes

##### typedoc-plugin-Markdown

- Please see typedoc-plugin-markdown migration guide for details on how to migrate from v3 to v4.

##### Sidebar

- A manual sidebar file should be referenced in `sidebars.js` rather than autogenerated configuration as previouslly recommended. See [sidebar guide](/plugins/docusaurus/guide/sidebar).
- With the updated configuration the existing sidebar options `position` and `categoryLabel` are no longer relevant.

##### Other options

- `includeExtension` has been removed as this behaviour is now the default.
- `frontmatter` option has been removed. Please use `typedoc-plugin-frontmatter`.
