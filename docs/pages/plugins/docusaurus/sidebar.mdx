# Sidebar

<Callout>
  Previous versions of this plugin recommended an autogenerated sidebar
  configuration. However we have decided it is more deterministic and
  configurable to use a manual sidebar configuration with a generated sidebar
  file.
</Callout>

A docusaurus sidebar file `typedoc-sidebar.cjs` is published to the relevant output directory along with the generated markdown documentation.

This file should be referenced in sidebars.js using a sidebar slice and can be configured in following way:

```js filename="sidebars.js"
module.exports = {
  typedocSidebar: [
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'Typedoc API',
      link: {
        type: 'doc',
        id: 'api/index',
      },
      items: require('./docs/api/typedoc-sidebar.cjs'),
    },
  ],
};
```

Please see https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar for sidebar documentation.
