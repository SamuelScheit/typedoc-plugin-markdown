# Suggested plugins

Any compatible remark plugins can be used (or you can write your own). Here are some that might be useful.

## [unified-prettier](https://github.com/remcohaszing/unified-prettier)

Improving code formatting by parsing with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/):

- Produces a consistent format.
- Removes unnecessary escape characters.
- Formats code blocks inside comment fenced blocks.

## [remark-github](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-github)

- Links references to commits, issues, and users in the same way that GitHub does in comments.

## [remark-toc](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-toc)
