# Versioning

This page should help you understand the versioning rules of the plugin and its compatibility with TypeDoc.

## Versioning Rules

Please note that TypeDoc is still released within the 0.x.x range and may include breaking changes within each minor version release.

For this reason we follow a slightly amended version of semver:

- **Patch** versions will include all bug fixes but might also include non-breaking new features.
- **Minor** versions will be released in sync with TypeDoc minor versions and will include any necessary API and feature changes to support the new TypeDoc version and features.
  Any option changes will attempt to be made in a backwards compatible manor.
- **Major** versions will be made if significant and breaking changes to the plugin are made.

## Compatibility Table

| typedoc-plugin-markdown | TypeDoc | Release Date |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------ |
| 4.1.x                   | 0.26.x  | 2024-06-21   |
| 4.0.x                   | 0.25.x  | 2024-05-03   |

## Specifying Version Ranges

You may prefer to fix versions or use a tilde (~) when declaring `typedoc-plugin-markdown` and `TypeDoc` versions in your `package.json` file.
The tilde allows only patch updates within the specified minor version.

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "typedoc": "~0.26.0",
    "typedoc-plugin-markdown": "~4.1.0"
  }
}
```
