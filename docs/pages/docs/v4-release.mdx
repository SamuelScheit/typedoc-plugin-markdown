## Migrating from v3

Migrating from v3 to v4 should be fairly straightforward. These pointers will help you understand the changes and how to update your project.

### Architectural Changes

- Handlebars as a dependency has been removed.
- Updated theming model. See [customizing output](/docs/customizing-output) guide.
- The way files are output has changed. Files and folders now follow your API module structure.
- Because the file structure has changed you may need to update any cross references to files in your documentation.
- Each member is now output to its own file by default. See [`outputFileStrategy`](/docs/options#outputfilestrategy). To achieve the same output as v3 (whereby only Classes, Enums and Interfaces have their own file), use [`membersWithOwnFile`](/docs/options#memberswithownfile)
- Parameters are output as a list by default. To achieve the same output as v3 (where parameters are output as a table), use [`parametersFormat`](/docs/options#parametersformat).

### Options Breaking Changes

- Setting `theme` to `"markdown"` is no longer required and should be removed.
- The option `indexTitle` has been removed. Please use the `"title.indexPage"` key with [`textContentMappings`](/docs/options#textcontentmappings).
- The option `allReflectionsHaveOwnDocument` has beeen removed (this behaviour is now the default). Please see See [`outputFileStrategy`](/docs/options#outputfilestrategy).
- The option `entryDocument` has been renamed to `entryFileName` to better reflect its purpose.
- The option `hideInPageTOC` has been removed. In-page TOC are no longer included by default. You can include in-page TOCs by using [typedoc-plugin-remark](/plugins/remark) and the [remark-toc](plugins/remark/suggested-plugins#remark-toc) plugin.
- The option `objectLiteralTypeDeclarationStyle` has been removed. Please use [`typeDeclarationFormat`](/docs/options#typedeclarationformat).
