# Changelog

## 4.0.0-next.xx

<Callout> v4 is a major release that includes a number of bug fixes, new features and UI improvements.</Callout>

### üèó Architectural Changes

- Handlebars as a dependency has been removed.
- Updated customization model with the ability to set hooks, events and cutom theming. See [customization guide]().
- Exposed navigation structure. See [navigation guide]().

### üåü Features

- Updated output file structure.
- Improved and cleaner UI.
- A set of updated and additional new options with comprehensive documentation.

### üöÄ Migrating from v3

Migrating from v3 to v4 should be fairly straightforward. These pointers will help you understand the changes and how to update your project.

#### üèóÔ∏è Structural Changes

- Each member is now output to its own file by default. See [`outputFileStrategy`](/docs/options#outputfilestrategy). To achieve the same output as v3 (whereby only Classes, Enums and Interfaces have their own file), set the [`membersWithOwnFile`](/docs/options#memberswithownfile) option.
- Parameters are output as a list by default. To achieve the same output as v3 (where parameters are output as a table), use [`parametersFormat`](/docs/options#parametersformat).

#### üí• Breaking Changes

- Because the file structure has changed you may need to update any cross references to files in your documentation.
- Setting `theme` to `"markdown"` is no longer required and should be removed.
- The option `indexTitle` has been removed. Please use the `"title.indexPage"` key with [`textContentMappings`](/docs/options#textcontentmappings).
- The option `allReflectionsHaveOwnDocument` has beeen removed (this behaviour is now the default). Please see See [`outputFileStrategy`](/docs/options#outputfilestrategy).
- The option `entryDocument` has been renamed to `entryFileName` to better reflect its purpose.
- The option `namedAnchors` has been renamed to `useHTMLAnchors` to better reflect its purpose.
- The option `hideInPageTOC` has been removed. In-page TOC are no longer included by default. You can include in-page TOCs by using [typedoc-plugin-remark](/plugins/remark) and the [remark-toc](plugins/remark/suggested-plugins#remark-toc) plugin.
- The option `objectLiteralTypeDeclarationStyle` has been removed. Please use [`typeDeclarationFormat`](/docs/options#typedeclarationformat).
