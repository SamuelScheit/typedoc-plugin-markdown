## Overview

By default [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org) will output API documentation as HTML.

This plugin enables TypeDoc to output documentation in Markdown. Since many tools and platforms support Markdown, the documentation generated by this plugin can be easily integrated into different ecosystems, such as code repositories, static site generators or documentation hosting services.

## Features

- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) compliant.
- Works alongside other TypeDoc plugins.
- Configurable output file structure.
- Configurable UX options
- [Frontmatter](/plugins/frontmatter) and [Remark](/plugins/remark) utility plugins available.
