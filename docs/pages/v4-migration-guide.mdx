# V4 Migration Guide

Migrating from v3 to v4 should be fairly straightforward. This guide will help you understand the changes and how to update your project.

## Architecture Changes

- Handlebars as a dependency has been removed.
- The way files are output has changed. Files and folders now follow your TypeScript project structure.
- In-page TOCs are no longer included by default. You can include in-page TOCs by using the [Remark](/utilities/remark) plugin.
- Updated theming model. See [customizing output](/customizing) guide.

## Breaking API Changes

- The option `allReflectionsHaveOwnDocument` has beeen removed (this behaviour is now the default).
- The option `entryDocument` has been renamed to `entryFileName` to better reflect its purpose.
- The option `hideInPageTOC` has been removed. In-page TOC are no longer included by default.
- Because the file structure has changed you may need to update any cross references to files in your documentation.
