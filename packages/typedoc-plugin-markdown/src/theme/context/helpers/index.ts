/**
 * The `helpers` namespace holds the helpers for the theme and are smaller utility functions that return snippets or text or other data transformations.
 *
 * Please note that partials:
 *
 * - Take a `model` param (that references a specific TypeDoc model) and an `options` param if required.
 * - Can reference other helpers but should not reference partials.
 * - Can return strings or other models.
